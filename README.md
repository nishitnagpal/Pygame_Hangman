# Hangman
Before Worddle became famous HANGMAN was the most popular word guess game with interesting graphics to keep a count of maximum attempts allowed to guess the word.

Using Pygame - a Python Library - I have designed a basic version of Hangman. Use your vocabulary skills and a bit of luck to guess the words in this game within maximum allowed number of tries. Try solving in as few tries as possible, Good Luck!

GitHub Pages primarily supports static content such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Pygame, however, is a Python library that requires a Python interpreter to run, which GitHub Pages does not support natively. Firstly, I created an index.html file to include a canvas for drawing the game and a script reference. Then restructured the Python application using JavaScript. I used HTML5 Canvas for drawing and basic JavaScript for the game logic.
